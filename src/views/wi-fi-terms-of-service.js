            We are offering this guest WiFi wireless Internet service (the
            “Service”) according to this Guest WiFi Wireless Networking
            Acceptable Use Policy (the “Policy”) as a free, non-public service
            to its visitors for the duration of their official visits. All users
            of this Service must agree to the terms of this Policy by clicking
            the ACCEPT button at login. We do not guarantee the Service or
            specific rates of speed. We also have no control over the
            information obtained through the Internet and cannot be held
            responsible for its content or accuracy. Use of the service is
            subject to the user’s own risk. We reserve the right to remove,
            block, filter, or restrict by any other means any material that, in
            our sole discretion, may be illegal, may subject us to liability, or
            may violate this Policy. We may cooperate with legal authorities
            and/or third parties in the investigation of any suspected or
            alleged crime or civil wrong. Violations of this Policy may result
            in the suspension or termination of access to the Service or other
            resources, or other actions as detailed below.

          <span>
            Users are responsible for ensuring they are running up-to-date
            anti-virus software on their wireless devices. Users must be aware
            that, as they connect their devices to the Internet through the
            Service, they expose their devices to worms, viruses, Trojan horses,
            denial-of-service attacks, intrusions, packet sniffing, and other
            abuses by third parties. Users must respect all copyrights.
            Downloading or sharing copyrighted materials is strictly prohibited.
            The running of programs, services, systems, processes, or servers by
            a single user or group of users that may substantially degrade
            network performance or accessibility will not be allowed. Electronic
            chain letters and mail bombs are prohibited. Connecting to
            &quot;Peer to Peer&quot; file sharing networks or downloading large
            files, such as CD ISO images, is also prohibited. Accessing another
            person&apos;s computer, computer account, files, or data without
            permission is prohibited. Attempting to circumvent or subvert system
            or network security measures is prohibited. Creating or running
            programs that are designed to identify security loopholes, decrypt
            intentionally secured data, or gain unauthorized access to any
            system is prohibited. Using any means to decode or otherwise obtain
            restricted passwords or access control information is prohibited.
            Forging the identity of a user or machine in electronic
            communication is prohibited. Saturating network or computer
            resources to the exclusion of another&apos;s use, for example, by
            overloading the network with traffic such as emails or legitimate
            (file backup or archive) or malicious (denial of service attack)
            activity, is prohibited. Users understand that wireless Internet
            access is inherently not secure, and users should adopt appropriate
            security measures when using the Service. We highly discourage users
            from conducting confidential transactions (such as online banking,
            credit card transactions, etc.) over any wireless network, including
            this Service. Users are responsible for the security of their own
            devices.

            We are not liable for any damage, undesired resource usage, or
            detrimental effects that may occur to a user&apos;s device and/or
            software while the user’s device is attached to the Service. The
            user is responsible for any actions taken from his or her device,
            whether intentional or unintentional, that damage or otherwise
            affect other devices or users of the Service. The user hereby
            releases the Company from liability for any loss, damage, security
            infringement, or injury that the user may sustain as a result of
            being allowed access to the Service. The user agrees to be solely
            responsible for any such loss, infringement, damage, or injury.

            By using this network, the user agrees to comply with and to be
            legally bound by the terms of this Policy. If this Policy or any
            terms of the Service are unacceptable or become unacceptable to the

            The Service may only be used for lawful purposes and in a manner
            that we believe to be consistent with the rights of other users. The
            Service shall not be used in a manner that would violate any law or
            infringe any copyright, trademark, trade secret, right of publicity,
            privacy right, or any other right of any person or entity. The
            Service shall not be used for the purpose of accessing,
            transmitting, or storing material that is considered obscene,
            libelous, or defamatory. Illegal acts may subject users to
            prosecution by local, state, federal, or international authorities.
            We may bring legal action to enjoin violations of this Policy and/or
            to collect damages, if any, caused by violations.

            will not send emails containing viruses or other malicious or
            damaging software. The user will run appropriate anti-virus software
            to remove such damaging software from his or her computer. The user

            offensive to us, including clear expressions of bigotry, racism,
            hatred, or pornographic material. The user will not access websites

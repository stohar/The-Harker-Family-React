              We are offering this guest WiFi wireless Internet service (the
              “Service”) according to this Guest WiFi Wireless Networking
              Acceptable Use Policy (the “Policy”) as a free, non-public service
              to its visitors for the duration of their official visits. All
              users of this Service must agree to the terms of this Policy by
              clicking the ACCEPT button at login. We do not guarantee the
              Service or specific rates of speed. We also have no control over
              the information obtained through the Internet and cannot be held
              responsible for its content or accuracy. Use of the service is
              subject to the user’s own risk. We reserve the right to remove,
              block, filter, or restrict by any other means any material that,
              in our sole discretion, may be illegal, may subject us to
              liability, or may violate this Policy. We may cooperate with legal
              authorities and/or third parties in the investigation of any
              suspected or alleged crime or civil wrong. Violations of this
              Policy may result in the suspension or termination of access to
              the Service or other resources, or other actions as detailed
              below.

              Users are responsible for ensuring they are running up-to-date
              anti-virus software on their wireless devices. Users must be aware
              that, as they connect their devices to the Internet through the
              Service, they expose their devices to worms, viruses, Trojan
              horses, denial-of-service attacks, intrusions, packet sniffing,
              and other abuses by third parties. Users must respect all
              copyrights. Downloading or sharing copyrighted materials is
              strictly prohibited. The running of programs, services, systems,
              processes, or servers by a single user or group of users that may
              substantially degrade network performance or accessibility will
              not be allowed. Electronic chain letters and mail bombs are
              prohibited. Connecting to "Peer to Peer" file sharing networks or
              downloading large files, such as CD ISO images, is also
              prohibited. Accessing another person's computer, computer account,
              files, or data without permission is prohibited. Attempting to
              circumvent or subvert system or network security measures is
              prohibited. Creating or running programs that are designed to
              identify security loopholes, decrypt intentionally secured data,
              or gain unauthorized access to any system is prohibited. Using any
              means to decode or otherwise obtain restricted passwords or access
              control information is prohibited. Forging the identity of a user
              or machine in electronic communication is prohibited. Saturating
              network or computer resources to the exclusion of another's use,
              for example, by overloading the network with traffic such as
              emails or legitimate (file backup or archive) or malicious (denial
              of service attack) activity, is prohibited. Users understand that
              wireless Internet access is inherently not secure, and users
              should adopt appropriate security measures when using the Service.
              We highly discourage users from conducting confidential
              transactions (such as online banking, credit card transactions,
              etc.) over any wireless network, including this Service. Users are
              responsible for the security of their own devices.

              We are not liable for any damage, undesired resource usage, or
              detrimental effects that may occur to a user's device and/or
              software while the user’s device is attached to the Service. The
              user is responsible for any actions taken from his or her device,
              whether intentional or unintentional, that damage or otherwise
              affect other devices or users of the Service. The user hereby
              releases the Company from liability for any loss, damage, security
              infringement, or injury that the user may sustain as a result of
              being allowed access to the Service. The user agrees to be solely
              responsible for any such loss, infringement, damage, or injury.

              By using this network, the user agrees to comply with and to be
              legally bound by the terms of this Policy. If this Policy or any
              terms of the Service are unacceptable or become unacceptable to
              the user, the user's only right shall be to terminate his or her
              use of the Service.

              The Service may only be used for lawful purposes and in a manner
              that we believe to be consistent with the rights of other users.
              The Service shall not be used in a manner that would violate any
              law or infringe any copyright, trademark, trade secret, right of
              publicity, privacy right, or any other right of any person or
              entity. The Service shall not be used for the purpose of
              accessing, transmitting, or storing material that is considered
              obscene, libelous, or defamatory. Illegal acts may subject users
              to prosecution by local, state, federal, or international
              authorities. We may bring legal action to enjoin violations of
              this Policy and/or to collect damages, if any, caused by
              violations.

              The user will use the Service only as permitted by applicable

              refrain from any actions that we consider to be negligent or
              malicious. The user will not send emails containing viruses or
              other malicious or damaging software. The user will run
              appropriate anti-virus software to remove such damaging software
              from his or her computer. The user will not access websites that
              contain material that is grossly offensive to us, including clear
              expressions of bigotry, racism, hatred, or pornographic material.
              The user will not access websites that contain material that
